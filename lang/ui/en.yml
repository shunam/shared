Social_recruiting_is_all_about_b: Social recruiting is all about <b>matching</b> in the same way as dating websites like Meetic.com or Match.com. Allowing graduates to communicate, share information with employees before accepting or declining a job is a win-win for both company and graduate since it allows both to prescreen each other beforehand. Social recruitment is all about matching employers and candidates. Any company has a human dimension, any company is made of men and women who work together. The match between candidates and companies must be done also based on this human dimension and not (as it is nowadays) based on a bunch of words (a.k.a job offer.
