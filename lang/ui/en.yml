Social_recruiting_is_all_about_b: Social recruiting is all about <b>matching</b> in the same way as dating websites like Meetic.com or Match.com. Allowing graduates to communicate, share information with employees before accepting or declining a job is a win-win for both company and graduate since it allows both to prescreen each other beforehand. Social recruitment is all about matching employers and candidates. Any company has a human dimension, any company is made of men and women who work together. The match between candidates and companies must be done also based on this human dimension and not (as it is nowadays) based on a bunch of words (a.k.a job offer.

Emphasize_your_most_relevant_skills_The: Emphasize your most relevant skills. The most obvious are technical (e.g. computing). The less obvious are your personal skills, which be equally important to the employer (e.g. self-awareness and management, interpersonal, oral communication, organizational, team working, problem-solving). As a (future) graduate it is likely that your work experience is disparate and not very relevant to your application (e.g. shop work, bar and factory work is quite common). Allocating a special section to the skills you have developed in a range of work (including voluntary work) and extra-curricular and study experience can serve to consolidate this information.
