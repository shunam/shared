It_can_sometimes_be_more_difficult: It can sometimes be more difficult than people expect to find an ideal job upon graduation. Graduates have the education but often lack any practical experience, making it a challenge at times to find that first job. At iStockCV we want to make this transition as smooth as possible (like a career advisor). This explains why iStockCV is focused entirely on the recent graduate segment.
